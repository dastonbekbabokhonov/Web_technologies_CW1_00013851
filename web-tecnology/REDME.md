# Sections: (The section functions remain the same on all pages)

# 1. Header
On the header section, you can access all the pages of my website, namely the above-given. I added a button that directs to the appointment section without any distractions. The header position is fixed to give more comfort to the possible user to access the links for moving other pages.

# 2.Body
In the body section, I created different cards and linked them over the project pages.

# 3.Footer
The footer section includes extra information and links to the proper pages. The user can switch to other pages by clicking the texts on page names.

# Page Descriptions:

# 1.Home page
On the home page I created a welcoming section with some illustrated pictures that describes a little about the clinic, the lower part highlights some advantages of services by a clinic, and the following part explains experienced doctors at the clinic and the possible partners.

# 2.Our services
This page describes the services of the clinic including Surgery, dermatology, Orthopeclics and tomography. All service categories are made in cards. At the lowest part of the website, there are some descriptions and online consultation buttons which should direct to a new page about consultation features and pricing, however, some contents do not link to the proper pages. The reason for this is the project only includes commonly used pages and is not for professional enterprises.

# 3. Find doctor
On this page, users can search for doctors and can filter for the department in their needs and can make an appointment.

# 4. News 
This page updates the most recent news regarding health and other health-related changes happening.

# 5.Reviews 
This part is built to show the reviews and clients' feedback about the services the company provides.

# 6. Live chat
This page is one of the most essential parts where clients can organize online appointments with doctors. and they also can book a doctor's time before going to the clinic.

# Conclusion:
This website was created to fulfil the Web Technology module's requirements and does not represent an actual company or service.
